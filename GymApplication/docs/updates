Things we need to do before the program is complete and ready

1)We need to make sure we know how to delete members that dont end their membership but get terminated as a result of the conract ending
2)So we made the decision that everytime we add a new member we will update the server same time.
3)Also we will have a copy of the list on the server so that we dont have to constantly access the server in the event of a query
4)we need a seperate logging file to make sure we keep track of the changes that need to happen to the server files as a security meassure
5)We also need to make sure that we make a function that will be responsible for billing the gym members every month
